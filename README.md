# Seizure-Detection
Design for a  a fully implantable, closed-loop neural probe for chemical neuromodulation in epilepsy, featuring a multishank neural probe embedded with microfluidic ion pumps (Î¼FIPs) for targeted GABA delivery, recording electrodes, and a seizure detection model trained using TinyML on an FPGA.
